Graduate project
-	Developed a working application where NAO humanoid robot can detect and recognize human members in two phases: (1) acquaintance mode: meeting and learning new members; and (2) assistant mode: act as a timer in group meeting.
-	Designed and implemented a system for NAO robot to interact with people and computer using self-taught Python. 
-	Built a TCP linkage between computer and NAO robot. 
-	Applied Face++ APIs to realize face recognition.
